% The frontmatter environment uses roman lower case page numbering. The
% abstract, acknowledgements, table of contents, list of figures, and
% list of tables are a part of this environment.

\begin{frontmatter}

% The Guide previously two abstract pages, one numbered, one without numbers.
% Now only a numbered abstract page is used in the thesis.
% The 'abstract' macro generates an unnumbered abstract page for the proposal.

\begin{abstract}
This is an abstract.  There are no page numbers.
The \emph{Guide} says an abstract should not exceed 350 words.

This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract. This is an abstract.
