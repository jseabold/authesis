% LONGTABLE
% To use longtable, add the following code to your preamble.
% Long table captions are single-spaced, but AU requires a
% double space between captions, so add to the pre-amble
% this redefinition (below) of the LT caption to your document.
% Also, attend to the order the captions are listed in the List of Tables.}

% The following command makes the title page, it is duplicated to produce

\maketitle

\maketitle

% The following command makes the copyright page

\copyrightpage

% The frontmatter environment uses roman lower case page numbering. The
% abstract, acknowledgements, table of contents, list of figures, and
% list of tables are a part of this environment.

\begin{frontmatter}

% The Guide requires one numbered abstract page.
% The 'abstractn' macro generates a numbered abstract page.
% Do NOT use the 'abstract' macro, which generates an unnumbered, abstract page.
% (The Guide no longer requires two abstract pages, one numbered, one without numbers.)


\abstractn

This is an abstractn.  It has a page number.
(AU no longer wants you to provide an unnumbered abstract page.)
The \emph{Guide} says an abstract should not exceed 350 words.
(If you do exceed this,
then under the CAS option, the first page is numbered bottom center, and the rest are numbered top right.)

This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn. This is an abstractn.

\caption{A normalsize table.
Captions for tables must go above the table.
Table captions must be single-spaced,
and the code indicates that they should be formatted as such.}
\begin{tabular}{lr}\hline\hline

TANSTAAFL & Milton Friedman \\
Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\small Use ctable or booktab for better looking tables.}

\subsection{Long Tables}

If possible, break long tables into pieces.
If you must, you can use the \texttt{longtable} package.
Get the supporting code from the preamble of autest.tex.
However, be aware that the \texttt{longtable} environment
can create problems.
In particular, a \texttt{longtable} does not float,
so table numbering may end up out of order.

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{ll}\hline\hline
\caption{Note that you must also place captions for longtables above your table.
This is not handled for you by LaTeX.}

\subsection{Long Section Names: First subsection of first section of introduction which is intentionally long to see what happens if it needs to break a line}


Another approach to fitting large tables is to shrink the fontsize.
We provide the \texttt{scriptsizetabluar} environment to help you with this.
Note that you can have a different caption in your List of Tables than
in the text, if you wish.

\begin{table}\centering
\caption[Alternative caption for List of Tables]{A table using scriptsizetabluar.}
\begin{scriptsizetabular}{lr}\hline\hline
Title & Author \\ \hline

Oh Yes There Is & John Maynard Keynes \\ \hline

Some was good and some was bad.

% Captions for figures must go below the figure.

Some was neither good or bad.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Surely mine will be better.
Here is a bulleted list of reasons why.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reason 1.
Some people hate the way test wraps in our bulleted lists,
but that is what the Guide says we have to do---apparently based on Turabian.
You can argue with CAS if you wish \dots
